# Methods required:
#   - Create a new folder, only for admins
#   - Set permissions for user on a folder, if read and write false, remove
#       entry.  Only for admins
#   - Add new account to a folder, only for users who can edit
#   - Delete account, only for users who can edit
#   - Get all public keys for an account, only for users who can edit
#   - Update encrypted data for an account, only for users who can edit
#       or own account
#   - Update public, encrypted private key pair and auth key (hashed server
#       side), only for authenticated user
#   - Get metadata for all accounts in a folder, only for authenticated user
#   - Get password for an account, only for authenticated user
#   - Get encrypted private key for a user, only for authenticated user
#   - Get all folders, only for authenticated user
#
# Also need an endpoint where multiple updates can be sent in a single request
# to be carried out.  Some operations such as changing a user password will
# require many different fields to be updated, this must be done in a single
# request so that if the client disconnects the database cannot be left in a
# half-updated state.  Break out actual update logic into own method that does
# not commit session.  Commit is then performed separately when all updates have
# completed.
